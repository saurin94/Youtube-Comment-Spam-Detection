Memory palaces can be useful for things that don't really matter. names and phone numbers are not important. Important information, unless really simple, should not be used in a memory palace. I want a good memory, so I can pass an exam. it is a complicated exam that does not rely on simple fact recall. it tests for my understanding. the process of making a memory palace for a subject I'm studying and the process for developing an understanding of a subject are not easily linked. Therefore, if it is important information, for example a subject you are studying, it is more effective to do it the traditional way. The reason a memory palace does not aid developing understanding is because the information is coded into imagery, which the brain's subconscious mostly won't interpret. I'm sure there will be a lot of people who disagree with me, perhaps you have other experiences. please share.\ufeff", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "Michael Britton", "cid": "z12qe10pux3wjfyvg224dbhzbxn3fjciu04"}, "z12uht4whmmtzhjww04cermjkvf2hnsheq00k": {"text": "love the intro\ufeff", "time": "2 weeks ago", "author": "dankus.memeius", "cid": "z12uht4whmmtzhjww04cermjkvf2hnsheq00k"}, "z12oth3jouz3cd1nw22qh3y4rs2bd3h2d.1491648878688184": {"text": "Thanks!\ufeff", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "HowToLucid.com", "cid": "z12oth3jouz3cd1nw22qh3y4rs2bd3h2d.1491648878688184"}, "z12uht4whmmtzhjww04cermjkvf2hnsheq00k.1491486031036559": {"text": "Did you have a look at the memory masterclass?
