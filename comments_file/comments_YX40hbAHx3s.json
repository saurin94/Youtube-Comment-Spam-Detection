There is a difference quotient formula used in calculus that goes: \nlimit as h goes to 0 (f(x+h)f(x))/((x+h)(x)).\nThis looks scary but it equates to finding the slope (y2-y1/x2-x1) (Slope formula) of your original function at every point and mapping it using another equation. In your case, \"^2\" will replace the \"f\" in \"f(x+h)\". Your new equation will be (((x+h)^2)((x)^2))/((x+h)(x)) and you should multiply out. You will end up with the monstrosity ((x^2+2xh+h^2)(x^2))/((x+h)(x)). Now we simplify by combining like terms and get h^2+2xh/h. Factor out the \"h\" from the top yielding h(h+2x)/h. Divide out the h's and you'll end up with \"h+2x\". Remembering h goes to zero, you're left with dy/dx (x^2) = 2x. Hopefully that wasn't too confusing. As a rule (shortcut) dy/dx c^n = nc^n-1. \nExample: dy/dx 2x^3 = (3)2x^(3-1) = 6x^2 or dy/dx x^2 = (2)x^(2-1) = 2x.\ufeff", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Miguel Martinez", "cid": "z13vgpiiltqgtndwx04cj3fooxnkizxwxt40k.1476116319524450"}, "z12bfnoi4nnfztt0t22dgnsgvri0idg4z04.1463397214159918": {"text": "+Jack Middleton Nope, that doesn't matter. We have proven certain other properties around computability where we can make definitive statements about every possible problem.\n\nIn fact, there are an infinite amount of unique problems and it is quite easy to prove. You can shuffle stuff around and define any problem as taking in a possible solution and deciding whether the solution is correct or not. It is trivial to build a problem that only accepts any single specific input (think \"5\" or \"166432\". There are an infinite amount of possible inputs so we can construct an infinity amount of problems.\n\nYou can even push it to an uncountable infinite amount of problems. By taking the powerset of all possible inputs (the set which contains all possible combinations of the inputs. This set is equivalent to the irrational numbers) you suddenly have an uncountable infinite amount of possible inputs. For any one of these combinations of inputs you can construct a problem which accepts any of the inputs in the combination (think \"5\" and \"13421\").\n\nSo by construction I have just defined an uncountable infinite set of problems.

Also, it's not just about decision problems.\n\nP and NP are classes of decision problems, which basically means problems that have YES or NO answers. In most cases, what we actually want to solve is a function problem or optimization problem. People tend to simplify these problems into decision problems because they are easier to analyze and reason about.\n\nA function problem is just a problem that has a complicated result. One variant is a counting problem, where we need to count a number of solutions to a sub-problem. Another variant returns a sequence of numbers, like FSAT (function SAT), which returns a sequence of assignments that will satsify a given boolean formula.\n\nAn optimization problem is even more interesting and, often, even more important. It asks us to find the best solution, for a given definition of best. Although TSP is often said to be NP-complete, its more useful varsion is the optimization version. The optimization problem version of TSP asks us to actually find the shortest path passing through a number of distinct points. The decision problem version of TSP asks if there exists such a path shorter than a given length: not that helpful in most situations.\n\nThere are separate problem classes that parallel P and NP for function and optimization problems. In some cases, a decision problem can be easy while the corresponding function problem can be hard, but this doesn't happen for decision problems that are NP-complete, so there is some reason to analyze decision problems after all.\n\nAn important thing that demonstrates just how coarse working with decision problems can be, is approximation.\n\nQuite often we don't want to find the answer to a puzzle, but rather just improve efficiency. Although TSP might ask to find the shortest path passing through a number of points, we might be quite satisfied with a path that's 1% longer than that. \n\nAnd when approximate answers are allowed, problems that seemed very similar in difficulty as decision problems become completely different beasts. \n\nFor example, the knapsack problem is NP-complete, but there is a polynomial time algorithm for giving an approximate answer to any degree of accuracy (it's polynomial in the approximation factor too, so it really is a fast and useful algorithm). That means that you can find an answer that's within 1%, 0.1%, or even 0.01% of the optimal one.\n\nOn the other hand, (obligatory disclaimer: unless P = NP...) unrestricted TSP is impossible to approximate to even a fixed constant factor using a polynomial time algorithm. That is, it's impossible to even find a path that's guaranteed to be 10 times as long as the shortest one. The best we can do is approximate it to a factor of log(n).\n\nTSP is a great example, because as we impose more and more constraints on the problem (constraints that still keep it NP-complete and therefore, under the lens of decision problems, \"equivalent\") it becomes easier and easier to approximate, and there are some versions with natural restrictions that can also be approximated to within any constant factor.\n\nAll of these differences are lost when you talk about decision problems. And we really don't know how things work when you consider average time complexity. Maybe NP-completeness-preserving reductions mess with that as well. We don't really know.\ufeff", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Greg Rosenbaum", "cid": "z12qh32z2sfcdvfi204cebiqxwivj5ljjbo"}, "z125gpppqvnxix4iz04cfpfy0nvxxrtbf0w": {"text": "P vs. NP is the reason we need quantum computing, A.I. to right software, robots so man has time to create answers to the enormous  amount of questions we will discover, time to look at the physical Universe, time to just learn and learn and learn and learn and learn, etc, etc, etc..We will not run out of things to do, quite the opposite.

In other words, on some arbitrary level, can we find some sequence of inputs that will complete the level? It turns out that this problem is NP-hard. As the length n of the level increases, in the worst case scenario, the amount of time it takes to find a solution (any solution, not just an optimal one) increases faster than any polynomial over n, unless P = NP.\n\nNote that this only applies to a \"generalized\" version of the game in which the map size can be altered arbitrarily and--crucially--the RAM can also be altered. In the real game, SMB1 uses extremely limited working memory, and sprites and most other objects are not loaded until they are on or near the screen. If you turn around, they simply reset to their initial state. This means if we do not allow the memory to increase arbitrarily, then no matter how large the level is, the total state space is still just a polynomial of the level size, so we can just traverse the entire state space in polynomial time, which will certainly solve the problem (indeed, it will find every solution). But if we do allow arbitrarily large memory, then the state space is not a polynomial of n but actually O(exp(n)), in the same way that the number of legal checkers positions on a generalized n x n checkers board is O(exp(n\u00b2)).\n\nThis is not like a puzzle, which is static. Mario's ability to navigate later sections in a level may depend on choices he made earlier. In the proof mentioned above, the decision of which path to take may lead to a mushroom that allows later paths to be traversable or that makes them impossible or may lead to a path with no mushroom which could itself have either effect. This means that at every new room, Mario may be forced to make irreversible changes that can affect whether he wins only much later on. Moreover, he may have to traverse some of these rooms multiple times to win. 2-dimensional mazes only have complexity O(n\u00b2) in the worst case, with n essentially being the number of dead-ends, since you can simply try every possible path until you find the correct one. In SMB1, the number of possible input sequences you can try is virtually limitless, increasing exponentially with time, whereas the number of meaningfully different paths you can take is still extremely large. Of course, that doesn't rule out the possibility that one could find a clever way to devise a strategy that ignores most of these paths and rapidly finds a solution if one exists, but the paper (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.1895v3.pdf) proves that the problem is NP-hard. In fact, it is NP-hard even to decide whether a solution exists at all, let alone find a specific solution (Theorem 3.1).\n\nBy the way, the proof also ignores some glitches in the game that would allow the listed gadgets to be beaten in a way they did not intend. In particular, the Variable and Finish gadgets can both be surpassed by using the wall entry glitch, which essentially allows Mario to squeeze horizontally through solid walls by exploiting the game's simplistic collision detection and wall-ejection algorithms.\ufeff", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "EebstertheGreat", "cid": "z133shjortzfsjhqp04cfba5mxibx3xrmag.1471781398123248"}, "z12ajx0aym2wwh4ha04chxuqzl34wj2bxgc": {"text": "But they solved PvsNP on Elementary and used it to steal money online :^)\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Piorn", "cid": "z12ajx0aym2wwh4ha04chxuqzl34wj2bxgc"}, "z12wf5moiu33insx304cgzeavtyrwflafao": {"text": "Thanks for this super understandable explanation.

You get a copy of one of these three from each of your parents, resulting in either a hetero or homozygous pairing. The E4 allele is widely known as the Alzheimer's gene. One copy and you have a 3 times more likely chance than a non-carrier to develop AD, and if you get two copies of the E4, you are sixteen(!) times more likely. Current research is going into what specific role ApoE4 has in protein misfolding, as misfolded tau and amyloid-beta proteins that aggregate in the brain are the mechanism for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's. Personally I think E4 carriers may be the key to delivering promising bacteriophages that have been shown to break up these amyloid plaques at E4 carriers are shown to have a degradation of the blood-brain barrier. Plus, they've been shown to exhibit CSF biomarkers decades before exhibiting AD symptoms, and they're the population that will be more widely served by the mechanism of these amyloid-plaque busting phages anyway. I hope I did it justice... I've written research papers using peer-reviewed medical journals specifically about apolipoproteins and protein misfolding in Alzheimer's.

So notice in your case you used n^1,000,000,000,000 which is the bigger number? n^1,000,000,000,000 or 1,000,000,000,000^n? So lets look at x^2 vs 2^x. If we were to graph both of these numbers x^2 would have points at 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 etc. Graphing 2^x will have 1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128. You can see that 2^x output grows more quickly than x^2. This is the growth rate of the function described in Calc 1. You are also correct that polynomial functions can be applied to an infinite amount of numbers, but so can exponential functions and the point is that the growth rate for exponential functions is significantly higher over time than polynomial functions. The reason that polynomial time is a useful qualification is because some problems can be computed in polynomial time while some other problems can only be computed in exponential time. So computers can solve any polynomial time problem faster than any exponential time problem. You would be correct in arguing that a computer could solve a relatively small exponential solution faster than an incredibly large polynomial solution (2^n vs n^1,000,000,000,000 for some small n) but that is not what is being discussed here. What is being discussed here are classes of problems and therefore the solution must be for all problems in the class, not comparing subsets of classes. So a polynomial time solution will need to be proven to provide a polynomial time solution for ANY input it is given (small or incredibly large). As such an exponential solution will need to be proven to provide an exponential time solution for any input it is given. The reason polynomial time is a useful qualification is that when comparing problem classes, polynomial time solutions are computationally faster than exponential time solutions (and many others as seen in the video).\ufeff", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Nice Dreams", "cid": "z13nflmxvkjpgvokk222h1wbzvqadzb3m.1463398209414490"}, "z13aybwr5r3aslwpt04cibxh3o3cerdacac.1453622002306138": {"text": "+behnamasid2 yah. did he, like, die?\ufeff", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Nardstorm", "cid": "z13aybwr5r3aslwpt04cibxh3o3cerdacac.1453622002306138"}, "z133shjortzfsjhqp04cfba5mxibx3xrmag.1466392627556285": {"text": "Not really.

I've been out of academia and work due to mental health issues since finishing my PhD, but still think there is some merit, somewhere, in this accumulation of random ideas on this matter. \nI have had times when, due to effects of stress and anxiety, my usual critical thinking is out of commission, thus leading me to automatically believe what, ordinarily, I would see issue with. (That is another story, and part of why my postdoc career never happened.)\n\nNow, this sort of problem fascinated me since being an undergraduate, and besides maths and logic, computer science and physics were my main two academic sources of fascination.\n\nThe thoughts:\n\n1. (Inspired by examples of when strengthening an induction hypothesis makes stuff easier) Some of my thoughts gravitated around deferring the asymptotics as long as possible, and thinking where possible in terms of explicit cycle counting.\n\n2. (Following on from (1), and inspired by machine coding in early computing and in embedded stuff) With regards to cycle counting, consider an explicit 'base machine', as a reference for cycle counting. When simulated machines are concerned, also consider cycle counting in the machine doing the simulation.\n(By cycle counting, I mean counting steps, but the term is borrowed from computing and low-level programming to capture the idea of counting cycles in the real underlying hardware machine, not in any virtual machine running on top of it.)\n\n3. (Rephrasing 2) I wonder the degree to which Blum's speedup theorem and similar involve factoring cycles into more complex instrucions in a simulated machine.\n\n4. (Thinking of the P vs NP problem itself) Cryptographic hashing functions. These are the inspiration. Now consider the problem, inspired by bitcoin, or what I term (NSA- or GCHQ-problems, that of determining whether a captured data packet contains encrypted meaningful data in some way): will this hashing function ever output identically zero (one can clearly replace this with the space of polynomial time computable functions from a string-space to the two element set {0,1}).\n\n5. Now going forward, if we require a function which takes an input string, and outputs a fixed-size hex string (or equivalently, outputs an integer from a finite set such as the first 2^64 integers), if the hash function\nis polynomial time to evaluate, then we clearly have an NP problem: given an input, we can check it in polynomial time*.\n\n5a. Strictly, when dotting i's and crossing t's, we need to explicitly state this in terms of a hash function that runs on a simulated machine. Then the input for the simulated machine is a code for the hash function and an input, in the case of checking,\nand just the source code for the hash function if trying to answer the question 'does this function ever output zero'.\n\n6. Give that, and when manic and in hospital, for fear of losing the idea forever, I sketched as a 1-page paper and (for real) tried to submit it to Theoretical Computer Science. I do crazy shit when I'm crazy, but there is a nothing-to-lose sense in that if anybody saw sense in what I wrote, it would have been worth it. (They didn't and that is no problem or surprise.)\nAlso, it lodges the thinking and ideas, and stores them, in a way that they aren't totally lost. Anyway:\n\n6a. Consider 'simulating the simulator', so we have, running on our bare-metal Turing machine, an outer emulator D, and inner emulator S, where S is the original simulator specified in our 'does this hash output zero' problem. The D is for 'Devil', inspired in part from Descarte's 'great deceiver' that led to his cogito ergo sum. The outer simulator's cycles aren't counted. What it is trying to do is to trick the inner machine, by analysing its state and source code, and considering input not-yet-looked at, and giving it the worse possible input at each step. The outer D machine is allowed to use any recursive means at its disposal, with no regard for computational complexity.\nSo the basic idea was to step through the simulation of a polynomial time 'solver' program, given it is running in polynomial time, and play a game of trying to trick it. (This is, in turn, also inspired by Turing's original halting problem.)\n\n6b. Along those lines, the simplest intuitive concept to have in mind is that, a procedure given only ten chances to look at a random list of numbers 11 or more entries long, cannot reliably tell whether or not one of those numbers was zero. It can only solve it by an exhaustive search through the list.\nNow a hash function is essentially a map from the set Sigma* of all strings over an alphabet Sigma, into a space of n-character strings over another alphabet (e.g. 64 char hex strings). Going back the other way, each output number corresponds to a region (usually infinite) of the input space. So this is a kind of 'preimage of zero' question, and\nin particular whether that preimage is empty or not. The thing with this outer simulator D, is that for each step of the inner machine, S, and each possibility of the next character it will look at, up to an arbitrary bound of possible input strings, it can evaluate every possible input string for the inner simulator and pick a worst-case scenario.\nIn this case, it is like a computer trying to brute-force a game like chess or go. Here, for D, checkmate corresponds to finding an input for which either the solver fails to give the right answer, or for which it exceeds its claimed polynomial bound.\n\n6c. The idea there is that, given a claimed P-time solver for this NP problem, and a claimed polynomial bound g(n), this method could construct either an example to show that the solver gives the wrong answer for some input, or that it exceeds its g(n) time bounds.\n\n6d. I didn't find how to either a) see why this doesn't work; or b) see how to turn the idea into a concrete argument.\n\n7. Another line of thinking was inspired by the compactness theorem from logic: a P-time solver for an NP-complete problem, for a fixed universal machine U, would have a smallest code for that solver. This is finite, of course, and suppose the size is N0. The 'predict the behaviour of this hash function' type prods one to think that there will be polynomial time hash functions which, whilst polynomial time, take a much longer polynomial than the solver, and have a much larger 'shortest expression'. \nFurthermore, one can, starting form a set of NP-complete 'yes/no' decision problems, arrange them any-old-how  and combine outputs to produce larger, more complex NP-complete problems, and continue ad infinitum. Thus we have infinite ascending chains of NP-complete problems each of which has a longer 'shortest code for a checker' than the ones before.\nI had, in my head, coined the term 'Robinson-Goldberg construction', as a play on Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson, to capture the intution and simultaneously have the formal-sounding name typical of mathematical results.\n\n8. The final thought was that, somewhere, in the mess that 7 generates, there would be some inequality, based in part on similar ideas to things like Blum's speedup theorem, as to the degree of efficiency to which a small polynomial-time program can reliably predict the behaviour of a large one.\n\nThis is really a 'here is a brain dump, do what you will' type of comment.

Because for complex problems which take decades (or maybe centuries) to solve, mathematicians don't have the luxury of simply going whichever way ... many start discarding solutions that obviously don't go the way their intuition tells them to go. Which is ok, because while you decide to attempt proving one way, there are others who go the other way and even though you are given direction by intuition, your final proof still needs to be mathematically sound.
